# Omarchy Mac

Omarchy 4 on Apple Silicon, alongside macOS: Asahi Alarm + Omarchy, installed
in one command, full-disk encryption included.

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/omarchy-mac/omarchy-mac)](LICENSE) [![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/omarchy-mac/omarchy-mac?style=social)](https://github.com/omarchy-mac/omarchy-mac/stargazers)

Already running Omarchy 3.x? This page is the fresh install — to upgrade in
place, see [docs/upgrade-to-quattro.md](docs/upgrade-to-quattro.md).

## Before you begin

- A recent backup of macOS (Time Machine or similar).
- An Apple Silicon Mac. M1 and M2 families are supported by Asahi: https://asahilinux.org/fedora/#device-support
- **M3 family (M3, M3 Pro, M3 Max): experimental.** Asahi boots it but has released no display or GPU driver, so the desktop renders in software with no brightness control and no external displays. The stock installer refuses M3; step 1 below has an M3 variant. Read [docs/apple-m3.md](docs/apple-m3.md) first.
- At least 50 GB free on the internal SSD (100 GB recommended).
- Internet access.

## Install

### 1. Run the Asahi Alarm installer, from macOS Terminal

```bash
curl https://asahi-alarm.org/installer-bootstrap.sh | sh
```

On an **M3-family Mac** run this instead. It uses the same Asahi Alarm images, swaps in Asahi's own installer package when Asahi Alarm's does not list M3 yet, adds the one line of installer data the M3 needs (firmware 14.8.3), and turns on the expert-mode question; answer yes to it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omarchy-mac/omarchy-mac/quattro/bin/omarchy-mac-asahi-install | bash
```

Choose `Asahi Alarm Minimal (BTRFS)` and allocate at least 50 GB for Linux.
The plain `Asahi Alarm Minimal` (ext4) works too — the setup below converts
it — but the BTRFS image already has the right shape.

### 2. Boot into Arch and get online

Log in as root (username: `root`, password: `root`) and connect first — 
everything from here starts with a download:

```bash
nmtui
```

Choose `Activate a connection` and connect to a WiFi network. Optionally 
`Set a system hostname` or set it during install below. Choose `Quit` when done 
to return to the prompt.

If `nmtui` shows an error right after activating the connection, reboot and try
again.

### 3. One command

Still as root:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omarchy-mac/omarchy-mac/quattro/bin/omarchy-mac-setup | bash
```

There is nothing to prepare beyond the network: no pacman update, no locale
setup, no user creation. The script installs what it needs, creates your user
and sets up sudo itself. To read it before running it, or to pass options:

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omarchy-mac/omarchy-mac/quattro/bin/omarchy-mac-setup
bash omarchy-mac-setup --no-encrypt
```

(`--repo <owner/repo>` installs from a fork the same way. `quattro` is the
repository's default branch and the script installs from it by default; it
checks the version it is about to install and stops rather than giving you
Omarchy 3 by accident.)

It asks whether to encrypt (yes by default), then for a hostname, username and
password, then carries the machine the rest of the way on its own — moving
`/boot` onto the EFI partition, encrypting the root, installing Omarchy —
rebooting between steps and resuming itself each time on tty1.

Expect about fifteen minutes, three reboots, and two questions along the way:

- **A gum dialog offering to build packages with no known aarch64 build.** Say
  no. `obs-studio` alone compiles for about three hours and then fails an
  architecture check. It defaults to no.
- **The disk passphrase**, chosen at the console on the boot that does the
  encryption. That boot rewrites every block of the partition, printing
  cryptsetup's own progress as it goes; on an M2 Max it runs at about 1 GiB/s.
  It is safe to interrupt: the next boot resumes where it stopped.

Encrypted machines log straight into the desktop afterwards: the passphrase at
boot is the authentication, and a second password immediately after it protects
nothing the first one did not.

Other flags: `--no-encrypt` skips the encryption and the boot-layout move it
needs, `--status` reports where a machine has got to, `--step <name>` re-runs
one step, `--abort` stops the guided run without undoing anything, and
`--keep-root-password` leaves root's password as Asahi Alarm shipped it instead
of locking it once your user has sudo.

## By hand

Every step the script drives can be run separately. The boot-layout move,
btrfs conversion, snapper snapshots and encryption are covered in
[docs/btrfs.md](docs/btrfs.md). Once a regular user with sudo exists —
the minimal image ships without `git` or `sudo`, so as root first:
`pacman -S --needed sudo git` — installing Omarchy itself is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omarchy-mac/omarchy-mac.git ~/.local/share/omarchy
cd ~/.local/share/omarchy
cat version    # 4.x — if this says 3.x you are on the wrong branch
bash install.sh
```

**Mind the branch.** A plain clone gets `quattro`, the default branch and the
Omarchy 4 line. `main` still carries Omarchy 3.x, and its `install.sh` installs
Omarchy 3 without saying which generation it is putting on the machine — an
easy hour to lose. `cat version` is how you check before committing to it.

The install takes under ten minutes on a good connection — most of the default
set comes prebuilt from the aarch64 package repo rather than being compiled
here. A few packages have no ARM build at all and are reported at the end
rather than failing the install; where building one would take hours and still
fail, the installer asks before trying, and `OMARCHY_TRY_UNAVAILABLE=1 bash
install.sh` forces the attempt.

## Troubleshooting

### SSH stopped working after the install

Asahi Alarm ships openssh enabled — the images are built for headless boards —
and Omarchy's install turns on a default-deny firewall that never opens port 22.
Nothing is uninstalled; the machine simply stops answering, which looks exactly
like sshd having been removed. Turn it back on deliberately:

```bash
omarchy-setup-security-sshd
```

It enables `sshd`, adds `ufw limit 22/tcp`, and offers to fetch your public keys
from `https://github.com/<user>.keys`. The same thing lives in the menu under
Setup → Security → SSH.

### The machine boots to `grub rescue>`

GRUB kept its modules and kernel on the root filesystem, and the root was
encrypted underneath it. See [docs/btrfs.md](docs/btrfs.md) — `/boot` has to be
the EFI partition before encrypting, which `omarchy-system-boot-to-esp`
arranges and `omarchy-system-btrfs-migrate` refuses to proceed without.

### Rolling back after a bad update

`omarchy snapshot restore` works on Apple Silicon. It offers snapper's
snapshots alongside `@fresh` — the system before Omarchy was installed — and
`@factory`, the installed system before it was yours, and says what you are
about to restore before doing anything. `/boot` is the EFI partition and sits
outside every snapshot; the tool warns when the restored root has no modules
for the running kernel.

### Mirrors are slow or failing

Run `bash fix-mirrors.sh` from the repository root and retry.

## Removal (uninstall)

There is no automatic uninstaller. Removal is done from macOS by deleting the
Linux partitions and growing the macOS container back over them. Follow the
[Asahi Linux partitioning cheatsheet](https://asahilinux.org/docs/sw/partitioning-cheatsheet/)
exactly — it identifies which partitions are Asahi's and which are macOS's own,
and the wrong `diskutil` target can take macOS with it. If unsure, open an
issue.
